# Mobile Legend : Bang Bang Heroes API Public

### Description

this is a mini project using the public API. This public API contains about mobile legend heroes, and the data there contains skill effects, attacks, durability, difficulty levels.

## Constraint

The problem with making this web application is that I can't get the hero_avatar (hero image). If called, it will be exposed to CORB (Cross-Origin Read Blocking), and I don't know how to handle it, so I downloaded the image resource myself. Then, the code that was written may still be a mess. I also don't know the design pattern (MVC , or something else) on this node.js.
